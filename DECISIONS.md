Platform & Framework

The app is built using Flutter for UI and Android native APIs for accessing real device data.

Flutter was chosen for fast UI development, while platform channels allow direct access to Android sensors without third-party plugins.

Sensor & Device Data

All data is intended to come from real Android system APIs, such as:

Battery info (BatteryManager)

Step count (SensorManager)

Activity detection (ActivityRecognition)

Wi-Fi and network info (WifiManager)

Cellular info (TelephonyManager)

Device details (Build)
