Overview

This app collects live health and device data from an Android phone and displays it on a dashboard. Users can share this data with nearby devices on the same Wi-Fi network.

Design Approach

Flutter handles the UI.

Android native code handles sensors, system data, and networking.

Communication between Flutter and Android uses platform channels.
